# Weather Forecasting using Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data to identify patterns in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The dataset used contains daily climate data from Delhi, India.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and converting date formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical insights and visualizations of temperature and humidity trends.
- **Time Series Visualization:** Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for trend analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Understanding relationships between weather features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `date`: Date of observation
- `meantemp`: Mean temperature (Â°C)
- `humidity`: Humidity percentage
- `wind_speed`: Wind speed (km/h)
- `meanpressure`: Atmospheric pressure (millibars)


## Results
- Generated trend analysis for temperature and humidity.
- Identified correlations between weather parameters.
- Provided interactive visualizations for better insights.
